## 📖 Overview

This project presents a reinforcement learning approach for autonomous path planning in robotic brain surgery simulation. An AI agent learns to navigate a surgical needle through complex 3D brain vasculature — avoiding blood vessels while reaching tumor targets — using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms.

Key highlights:
- **98–100% training success rate** with tabular Q-Learning over 3,000 episodes
- **80–100% generalization** to unseen tumor targets
- **0% vessel collision rate** vs. 40% for straight-line approaches
- **≥4mm safety margin** guaranteed from all blood vessels
- Full integration with a Franka Panda robotic arm via Inverse Kinematics

## 🤖 RL Formulation

### State Space
3D voxel grid position (2mm resolution) relative to tumor location.

### Action Space
6 discrete moves: `{+X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z}` (2mm per step)

### Reward Function
```
R(s, a, s') = R_goal + R_collision + R_timeout + R_shaping
```
- `R_goal = +100` — reaching the tumor
- `R_collision = -100` — vessel proximity < 4mm
- `R_timeout = -50` — exceeding 100 steps
- `R_shaping = Δd` — distance reduction to target

### Hyperparameters
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Learning rate α | 0.15 |
| Discount factor γ | 0.95 |
| Epsilon (start → end) | 1.0 → 0.01 |
| Epsilon decay | 0.997 |
| Max steps/episode | 100 |
| Training episodes | 3,000 |

## 🐳 Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included for containerized, reproducible execution.

### Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t brain-surgery-rl .
```

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run --rm brain-surgery-rl
```

> **Note:** PyBullet GUI visualization requires passing through a display. On Linux, use:
> ```bash
> docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix brain-surgery-rl

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Static environment (no tissue deformation modeling)
- Discrete action space limits path smoothness
- Single-needle, straight-segment paths only
- Simulated environment differs from real surgical conditions

---

## 🔭 Future Work

- Extend to continuous state/action spaces using actor-critic methods
- Incorporate curved needle steering for challenging targets
- Multi-objective optimization (path length, clearance, energy)
- Dynamic replanning with real-time MRI/CT intraoperative feedback
- Sim-to-real transfer for physical Franka Panda deployment
- Training on diverse anatomical models for patient-agnostic planning
